/*

You need to write a C++ addon that returns an object with the following keys: 
findUpper, hasUpper, findLower,  lcletters, ucletters.

The values for findUpper, hasUpper, findLower are all functions.

The values corresponding to lcletters and ucletters are strings.

The first parameter to findUpper is a string that may contain uppercase letters, 
the second parameter is a string that contains the uppercase letters we are interested 
in.

If the second parameter is empty then any uppercase letter present in the
first string needs to be found.
The parameter to hasUpper is a string.

If it is not empty then only the uppercase letters specified in the string
 need to be checked for.

If they are present then this function would return true otherwise false.
If the input string is empty then all uppercase letters need to be searched for.

The first parameter to the findLower is a (JavaScript) function and the second 
and third parameters are strings.

You need to call the JavaScript function passing the second parameter as 
its first parameter and each character in the third parameter once to 
ee if the character is present.

The JavaScript function will return a bool to the C++ function to indicate
 if the character is present or not.

The strings lcletters and uc letters contain the lowercase and uppercase 
letters from the original string passed to ant of the three functions findUpper, 
hasUpper and findLower.

Each find function would return the letters it found.
